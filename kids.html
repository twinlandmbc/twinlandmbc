      <p><h5>Jesus said, <b>"Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven."</b><br>- Matthew 19:14 </p>
      <p>The Children's Ministry at Twinland Missionary Baptist Church is anchored by this verse of scripture. Each program and event provided for our children is Bible-based and designed to help children learn about God and how to apply that knowledge to their lives. Each program is led by dedicated Christian teachers that realize that this responsibility is biblical. We have no higher priority than leading children to a closer relationship with Christ.</p>
      <p>The Children's Ministry's purpose is to make church a place where children want to be!!! Our programs are exciting and fun while being instructive and inspirational for each child.</p>
      <p>We believe that each parent (or guardian) is vital in this ministry to your child, so we welcome you to participate, observe and suggest.</h5> </p>

           <b>Who is Jesus?</b> <br>
           -The son of God and the savior of the world! <br>
           <b>2. Why did the Jewish leaders and teachers not like Jesus?</b><br>
          - They didn’t like what he was doing (miracles) or that he claimed to be the son of God.<br>
          <b>Did Jesus do anything wrong?</b><br>
          -No<br>
          <b>4. After Jesus was arrested and turned over to the roman soldiers to be crucified, what happened?</b><br>
          - He was hurt and spit on. His clothes were torn and taken from him. A crown of thorns was put on his head. He was beaten so badly, that he could barely stand on his own. He was forced to carry his cross so far up a mountain, that he needed help because he could not do it on his own. He was nailed to a cross and he died. <br>
          <b>5. Why didn’t Jesus save himself from the cross?</b><br>
          -He knew he had to die to save people from their sins. <br>
          <b>6. Did Jesus stay dead in the tomb?</b><br>
          -No, he rose again on the third day. <br> 
          <b>7. What did Jesus teach the people?</b><br>
          -What he did (die on the cross and rise again) was the only way that they could be forgiven and be with God forever. <br> 
          <b>8. For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, so that everyone that believes in him, will not perish, but have what?</b><br>
          -Eternal Life <br> 
          <b>9. What does John 3:16, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” mean?</b><br>
          - It means that God loved everyone (even you and me) so much, that he gave Jesus (His only Son) to die on the cross, so that whoever believes in Jesus will not die and go to Hell, but live forever and ever with Jesus in Heaven. <br>  
          <b>10. Do you have any questions about what Jesus did for you?</b> <br>           
          -Let your child talk to you about anything they may not understand. This may be the time that you kiddo asks the big question, “How can I be saved?”. Be ready to help guide your child through salvation. Do NOT push your kid to be saved, when they are ready, they will let you know! Below are two links to two Youtube videos (about 1-2 min each), that can help your child understand how to be saved. </h5><br>

           -Joseph was killed by wild animals.<br>
           <b>2. What actually happened to Joseph?</b><br>
          -Joseph was sold and became a slave.<br>
          <b>3. Was Joseph a good slave?</b><br>
          -Yes, he was trusted by Potiphar and was promoted. Joseph was now in charge of everything that Potiphar owned.<br>
          <b>4. Potiphar’s wife liked Joseph and wanted to kiss him. Did Joseph kiss her? Why?</b><br>
          -No, because he was a good man. He knew it was not right because she was married and Joseph was working for Potiphar.<br>
          <b>5. When Joseph ran from Potiphar’s wife, what happened?</b><br>
          -She grabbed his clothes and lied. She told her husband (Potiphar) that Joseph tried to kiss her. Joseph was sent to jail and became head of the other prisoners. <br>
          <b>6. What was the butler's dream?</b><br>
          -Three branches gave big grapes. He squeezed the grapes into a cup and gave it to the King (Pharaoh).<br>

          -Three baskets filled with bread. Birds came and ate all the bread.<br> 
          <b>8. What did Joseph say the dreams meant?</b><br>
          -In three days the butler would become Pharaoh’s (the King’s) butler again but the baker would be hanged.<br> 
          <b>9. Did the butler remember to tell Pharaoh (the King) about how Joseph can interpret dreams?</b><br>
          -He forgot until the Pharaoh (King) had a dream and no one knew how to interpret it. They took Joseph from prison and the Pharaoh (King) told him his dream.<br>
